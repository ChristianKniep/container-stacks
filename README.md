# stacks naive


![docker-compose](d-compose-img.jpeg)

This repo has docker compose files to start different __stacks__ for different porpuses.

This repo has __naive__ in its name to point out that therer are __naive__ assumptions in this way of writing docker-compose files. Currently the main naive asumtion is, that we assume you are just using these stacks in non production environments or more or less just on development hardware like notebooks and workstations.
